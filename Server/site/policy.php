			Thanks for using ARIN.
		</p>
		<p>
			By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully. 
		</p>
		
		
		<hr/>
		
		
		<p>
			Don’t misuse our services. You can only appropriately use it for education purposes. You will be banned otherwise. Using our services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our services or the content you access. You may not add images unless you have permission from the owner. Do not remove, obscure or alter any legal notices. In connection with your use of the services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and ban/terminate accounts of infringers according to the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights, you can notify us.

		<p>
			The app does not collect any statistics or any similar information. We do not give your personal account information to others unless requested with the aid of legal warrants. Your email address/username can be shown to moderators. The server is hosted on a free web server currently (hostinger.co.uk). You will also abide by their <a href="http://www.hostinger.co.uk/tos" target="_blank">terms of services</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			There may be ads displayed in the app.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app will download fish images to your phone, that others have uploaded. The settings button in the menu can be used to clear all downloaded images. Your uploads and contributions will be seen by others (except your account information). There can be moderators who monitor the content but may not have gone through everything at any point in time.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may be subject to errors on the app when using it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Logging in online and downloading database information may be extremely large if the database gets large enough. You should use Wi-Fi connection when possible. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The app may use your current location when uploading images to the web as part of the geo-tagging process in order to automatically attach locations to the fish species. Any images with geo-information attached, may have its location information used by the app.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently "as initial" data, we have some images from the book "The ROM field guide to freshwater fishes of Ontario" by Erline Holm, Nicholas E. Mandrak and  Mary E. Burridge. These images can changed by the community so they are dynamic.
		</p>
		<p>
			The website/forums does not use SSL encryption, so you don't need to use important information when signing up.
		</p>
		<p>
			The entire security (app and website) is not very developed at the moment.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will consider giving a fair and nice rating/review after using the app. =)
		</p>

		<p>
			The information above might be unprofessional as it is done by a student not that great at writing privacy policies. The <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en/policies/terms/regional.html" target="_blank">Google version</a> was used as a sample in order to write the above.
